I attempte the Heroku deployment, but was unsuccessful-
Heroku free is ending
Heroku add-on MLab doesn't exist since 2020

Here is what I tried:
I set up an account with Heroku and installed the CLI
I used the MongoDB Atlas, which is supposed to be the replacement for MLab
I got to the point where I could get a connection string
I put it in the server.js

I got confused on what to do next and couldn't figure it out.  I tried numerous unsuccessful things.

I have included screenshots of what I did manage to do.
